# Detection_Notification-Computer_Vision


## Background
This project is aimed at creating a system that is able to notifiy an individual once a certain object or person has been detected. 

## Use cases
An example of this is Reception Desks. Receptionists have alot on their plates, printing, admin, develiering and cleaning to just name afew. Too often they have to leave the desk unattended, which means that anyone that approaches the desk is unable to get assistence. The solution here is a system that can detect a person at a desk and send a digital notification to the receptionist. 

# Approaches
There are two approaches taken in this project: 

  - Twilio API (Whatsapp Notification)
  - Email API (Email Notification)

# Extra Functionality 
With the Email Notification approach you are also able to capture an image of the detected object and attach it to Email.
