# DetectionNotificaiton-ComputerVision

This project is aimed at creating a system that is able to notifiy an individual once a certain object has been detected. 

An example of this is Reception Desks. Receptionists have alot on their plates, printing, admin, develiering and cleaning to just name afew. Too often they have to leave the desk unattended, which means that anyone that approaches the desk is unable to get assistence. The solution here is a system that can detect a person at a desk and send a digital notification to the receptionist.
